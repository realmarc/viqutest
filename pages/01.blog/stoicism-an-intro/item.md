Stoicism is a very ancient philosophical doctrine founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century B.C. It became famous in the ancient world thanks to great people like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus, and since then it has been a very popular school of thought that many people believe in today, and improve their lives following its principles. Here are the key things you need to know about stoicism:

##### 1. What is stoicism?

It is a philosophy that claims that the virtue translates into happiness, and that people should be judged based on their behavior instead of their words. It is also a pretty individualist and assertive school of thought, since it asserts that since we can’t control any events that happen to us, we should focus instead of controlling how we respond and react to them. 

Focusing most of its teachings in the unpredictability of the world, the briefness of existence and the frequency at which we tend to react illogically to outside events, it tries to teach its followers to let go of useless attempts to control external situations, seize the day by acknowledging how fast it all ends and to realize that most unhappiness people experience is caused by their impulsive reactions based on reflexive senses instead of logic.

What differentiates stoicism from many other philosophical doctrines is that it does not try to provide an answer to metaphysical questions and does not intend to explain the world and existence with complex theories, it just tells its followers how to defeat destructive emotions, change what they can change and not be concerned with what cannot be changed.

##### 2. Why is stoicism important for modern society?

While many people base their lives on complicated philosophical doctrines and theories that make way more sense in theory and paper than in real life, stoics –the name given to people who practice stoicism- are only concerned with what is practical and can be applied to the real world, making stoicism a doctrine that is easier to understand and follow in our real lives than many other schools of thought.

We live in a frenzy world that involves many complex and thought-provoking issues, and it can be overwhelming some times for many people the realization that they live in a world they do not control, that whatever they do or accomplish they cannot save the world and that existence is brief and confusing. If you feel like you are constantly stressed about this issues but most philosophical doctrines are too hard to understand or apply in real life, maybe stoicism is for you. 

It is an incredibly powerful school of thought, especially in the 21st century, since the world moves way faster than any one can understand. By adopting the principles of stoicism, you can learn to let go of the problems you cannot solve –and maybe you should not even be trying to in the first place- and only spend your precious time and effort with the things that you can actually change and improve by and for yourself. Because of this way of thinking, many people affirm that stoicism is a very liberating philosophical doctrine that has greatly reduced their concerns and stress levels. If you want to start applying right now some of the key principles of stoicism without diving into a book and learning all that there is to know, you can try some of these two easy real life exercises:

##### 3. Train your mind to stop categorizing things as either bad or good

As we have mentioned before, we live in a complex world where we don’t control many of the things that happen to us. Stoicism suggests that, when confronted with a particular situation, we avoid our natural reflex to categorize it as good or bad and start thinking about it as an opportunity.

A simple example of this would be getting fired from your job. Instead of immediately thinking that is something bad for you, you could try to perceive it as an opportunity to meet new coworkers, polish your job interview skills or even begin a new career.

Doing this will go great lengths to help you stress less about any bad situations and exploit more the opportunities they always bring with them.

##### 4. Constantly remind yourself about your own mortality

While most people, especially in the 21st century, meditate about how brief life is, they tend to get depressed and start to stress over the fact that they will probably not have enough time to accomplish all they want. But if you are trying to adopt a stoic view of the world, you should constantly meditate about your own mortality, but from a completely different point of view:

Instead of stressing about the briefness of life and how it is not as long as you would want, you should remind yourself that time is a pressing matter and you should not waste any single day. Whether you reach an important career milestone or just go out to the park, relax and contemplate all the great things that surround you, you will be getting the most out of your life and you will feel, no matter how old you are, that everything has been worth it. It is a great change of perspective that not only will make you happier, but also will make you way more productive.
