Stoicism is far from philosophical theories and arguments on what is right and wrong. We all have a purpose that justifies our existence. This school of philosophy is based on action rather than endless debate; judgment and virtue with regards to wisdom and happiness is based on behavior, not words. According to Stoicism, life is unpredictable and we do not have control over external events; however, our happiness is defined by our reaction and responses to the external events. Dissatisfaction and happiness squarely lies on our reflexive senses impulse defense rather logic. The complicated theories in the world have nothing to do with happiness; it is about overcoming the destructive emotions and controlling our reactions.
Happiness is a primary source of debate in philosophical fields; Stoicism helps you to crack the theories and endless debate with action techniques. Here are important lessons you can learn from Hellenistic philosophy.

##### You have the control
 We do not have control over events, how and when they happen; however, we can control what they mean. The human mind is a powerful tool that coordinates activities with respect to reaction and explaining incidents in life. Everything that happens in your life can be controlled by the mind; you either perceive it to be good or bad. How you choose to interpret the events determine the future; your happiness in the next 2 seconds and following months and years is dependent on how you choose to perceive a natural event. Train your mind to be sober in making decisions, do not be a slave of fate; a result is only negative if you choose to perceive it that way.
 
##### You cannot avoid hurdles to serenity
Challenges and obstacles to tranquility are intrinsic characteristics of life. You cannot avoid these challenges; you have to face them on a daily basis if you are to achieve anything life. In fact, if you are not encountering any obstacles in life it means you are not moving. Goals have to achieved meaning fighting through obstacles. Stoicism demonstrates the easiest way to get past the obstacles is making right choices; how you judge and interpret situations determines tranquility in life.

##### Disrupt yourself
Get yourself out of comfort zone; if you are keeping to same old habits then you are likely to get same results. Additionally, the environment around you and the whole world keeps on changing, if you are static in your decisions, you are bound to lose a lot because you will be no longer in control. Disrupt yourself from habits, try new techniques; face your fears and be in control of your happiness.

##### You always have a choice 
Whether you are at the peak of your life or low, probably in jail; you determine your emotions and happiness. Be in control of what you think; choose to perceive the event positively. If you are punished by law yet innocent, you have a choice to take it positively and learn patience and justice in life or languish in oppression thoughts. No matter what life throws at you, you can control your choices; we have the freedom to choose, which sets us free and happy in the end.

##### Practice poverty
Stoics believe practicing hardship is the best way to prepare for hardship. Stoicism does not involve any theoretical formula; it is all practical. Practicing poverty is the best way to prepare for ups and downs in life. As mentioned, life is unpredictable; you never know when you will lose your investment or job. The thought of failure or drowning in debts is frustrating and scary; it is important to familiarize with such circumstances before they come. The best way to practice poverty, for instance, is during prosperous times of our life. Comfort is a form of slavery because you will live in constant fear of losing your property or money hence persistent mind torture. You can put an end to such fear by practicing what you fear; it frees you up from slavery of uncertainty. 
Commit to eating cheap meals consistently for a month or two; live as if you are spending the last coin. This will help with appreciating simple meals; you might also learn different cooking styles. Eventually, you will be okay with living on a tight budget; it will no longer be a bother in your mind hence happiness.

##### Avoid the need to seek approval
It is common for people to behave in a certain way or make decisions based on how other people will perceive them. Focus on impressing yourself and personal growth other than colleagues, neighbors, and family; do what makes you happy and apologize later, if you must. The people you seek to impress have their own challenges and addictions; it is unwise to try impressing people who are struggling with the same thing. Actually, you will be wrecking the purpose of life, happiness, impressing others works on the opposite of your happiness. Human beings naturally seek approval; you need to go beyond yourself and find happiness.
Stoicism is about being a good human and self-satisfaction. There are endless life hacks to do with achieving individual purposes in life; all that matters to life fulfillment is happiness. Note that we have no control over external obstacles, they will come, but you can control the challenges with your choices and perception.
