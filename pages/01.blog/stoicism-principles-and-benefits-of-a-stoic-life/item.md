The world, at all its ages, has been chaotic, unfair and cruel. That is the truth for a lot of people if they choose to focus on bad and sad things and facts. You can always find tragedy without trying too hard to find it. It is not a lie that the world can be a very dark place, but in the end, you can decide if you focus your attention and lifestyle on it, or if you try to be happy with all you’ve got. That way of thinking is one of the most important parts of stoicism. But, is it really possible in the real world to follow it? Is it even a good idea? Let’s review some of the benefits you can get and how can you achieve them.

##### 1. It is based on chaos and hard times.
Stoicism surged in Athens after some major wars where no one was safe and crisis was abundant. The philosopher Epictetus, who was a crippled slave, noticed that being sad and miserable about it was his choice and no one else’s. Then, after studying a lot and creating a new way of thinking, he started teaching his new philosophy to students, and now it is one of the most important ones in the world. 
This idea can be very helpful for you because it shows you that everything material or in the exterior can be gone, destroyed or taken away at any moment, and that is completely out of your control. You will notice that there is just one place that the world can not reach to affect you, and that is your inner self and with that, your decision to be happy, brave, and good.

##### 2. Control your mind
One of the most important things to understand is that you have complete control and power inside your mind, but not on the outside. Basically, you must know that you cannot really control what happens in the world, even if you can influence it; in the end, the world will continue changing, having events and going on without asking you what do you want or what do you think about. Therefore, you should focus on what you can control, and that is you. Control your mind and the way you process everything that happens outside, and you will achieve happiness under any circumstances because you will be able to just decide it.

##### 3. You are dying every day
This is not as dark as it sounds, but it is true. The idea is that every day, every hour, every minute, and every second that passes, you are getting older, so you must make it count. Always be aware of this and try to live the best you can, do everything you want to do as soon as you can and never stop dreaming for more. To be stoic does not mean to stop aspiring to new things, but to be ok with anything you can or cannot get. The fact is that we have a limited time in this world and that we, once again, can decide how to live it and what to do with it.

##### 4. Appreciate yourself
You must develop the ability to be conscious of where you are, how you are, and what you are at all the times. Present consciousness is something that we, as humans, tend to forget because we are always thinking about what is next, how will it be and how to get there. We must start focusing on each moment that is occurring; otherwise, we will never really appreciate what we achieve.
Start being conscious about the present with little practices like thinking about your surroundings, try to feel your senses and emotions. Stop for one moment in your busy day and check everything that is happening at that precise moment. Is it cold where you are? Can you feel the humidity? Are there any birds singing? Is the sunlight pretty for you? Ask and respond to yourself this kind of questions to test your senses and you will start enjoying the absolute present.

##### 5.You are enough
A partner in your life is something that can be very good for you; family, friends, and co-workers can really fill your life in really good ways, but you will not be able to enjoy that if you can’t enjoy yourself. To learn to be alone, that is the real need. A lot of people is afraid of being alone, they hate the loneliness feeling and that brings them a lot of suffering. Therefore, it is really easy to be an addict to the company of some people and to try to have it at any cost. That is a really toxic feeling that will, sooner or later, push away the people we love.
If you realize that you are enough for yourself and you learn how beautiful can loneliness be at the right amounts, you will be better at company and you will achieve a lot more happiness.

A stoic life has a lot of benefits, but it can be a difficult and long road. It can be the perfect medicine to treat really hard times and it has been that for a lot of people along human history. Learn to enjoy the simple things of the world and you will start to be happier.
