Stoicism is an ancient form of philosophy made popular in recent times from the United States who tried to break the hitherto complicated term into much simpler terms using lay man languages. Here we will help you understand what stoicism means and how you can enjoy the benefits it brings to make your life simpler. The idea of stoicism began on a stoa, what we know today as a porch. Let's break this down into simper terms to help you understand the concept of Stoicism.

##### 1. Understanding Stoicism 
Stoicism pays attention to the most uncomplicated life theories.
Stoicism is so uncomplicated that you can take necessary actions from the advice you get from it almost immediately.
You do not need any studies before you can understand the concept of stoicism.
Some of the most widely read Stoic include Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Seneca. 
So, what is stoicism?â€¨
Stoicism can be said to be a kind of ancient meditative practice that allows you take all the negative feelings you experience, and turn them into positive thoughts that bring you enhanced peace of mind and a positive outlook on life. 

Having the right state of mind at all times is the most important aspect of learning Stoicism. The right state of mind is important to help you look at life challenges in the most positive light. 
Some important things Stoicism can teach you
You have no control over life events, but you can control what each event means to you
This is one very popular teaching from most modern day Stoics. Life will always bring you loads of negative experiences, but how they experiences make you feel and what they mean to you can be entirely controlled and determined by your mindset and mental attitude towards them. Once this idea sinks into your consciousness, you can take back the power to control how life's events affect the life you live. This will help you become a lot calmer and less reactive to these events because it gives you an upper hand over your circumstances in life. 

##### 2.You cannot avoid disruptions to serenity 
It is impossible for you to reach a tranquil state of mind by trying to block out distractions or horrifying events in life. The right way to get to that place of tranquility is through the choices you make and how you judge life events and situations. 
You have to learn to disrupt yourself
If you continue doing things the same way without accepting changes, something or someone who changes with times and the environment will disrupt your life. When you continue to operate and do things out of habit, it shows you have stopped using your mental ability to think about situations and events before you take action. It shows you are simply drifting through life mindlessly. It shows you have lost control of your life. And once you have lost control, your environment determines your results at all times. And believe me, the results you will get might not always be the things you would love to get. The important lesson Stoicism tries to teach you here is to learn to break your habits, leave your comfort zone and disrupt yourself and age-long habits. 

##### 3. You have a choice whether the situation is good or bad.
Whether you are a successful businessman running your business or a prisoner, Stoicism helps you understand you always have a choice to make no matter your situation and circumstances. Everyone of us will go through his own highs and lows in life because we all come from different backgrounds. However, the important lesson is that through all of life circumstances, you do have a choice. In the long run, it is the freedom of choice that will set you free, It is that same freedom of choice that will ensure you do not waste your time and entire life away thinking about the stuffs you have no control over. So, no matter how hard life pushes you, you will always enjoy the power of control when you learn to control your choices. 

##### 4. Form the habit of looking inwards at all times 
Every Stoic takes time to look inwards. This is one major teaching every Stoic emphasizes on. Stoicism teaches you to take time every morning to ask yourself certain important questions about your life. As you continue to practice this, you will begin to find relevant answers to some of life's biggest questions. Looking inwards daily will help you discover you have always known but always felt they were hidden in some other things or some other person somewhere else. This practice won't work unless you are very honest to yourself. You don't need to be brutal either. Just be fair to yourself. 

##### 5. Conclusion 
Don't wreck your own life trying to impress anyone or living your mind unprotected. Learn to guard your mind against negative influences that make you lose control of your life. In Stoicism, how you handle ugly situations is what builds you the character you need to get the best from life. Stop allowing problems to spoil your peace of mind and mindset-let optimism be your guide at all times. Life is hard already, don't make it any harder by making the wrong choices.
